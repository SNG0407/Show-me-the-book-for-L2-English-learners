This study introduces a new approach of integrating vibrotactile actuator beneath the chair to deliver haptic feedback mimicking heart-beat based on beats per minute (BPM) parameters. These BPM signals were estimated from Phonocardiogram which essentially captures the acoustic signals generated by the heart. However, the raw Phonocardiogram (PCG ) are complex in nature and often contains noise and artifacts, and cannot be played directly for haptic feedback. To this end, we have developed an approach for synthesizing these PCG signals to provide heart-beat haptic feedback. This method begins by utilizing a PCG recording from a human subject. Subsequently, a smooth envelope is estimated from these signals. Then, PCG signals are synthesized by generating sine waves that fill up these envelops, producing sense of realistic heart-beat. The efficacy of this approach was validated through a pilot user study, emphasizing its perceptual effectiveness.

1. Introduction
Haptic feedback, utilizing our sense of touch, has gained prominence recently, enriching user experiences in various applications such as medical simulators, gaming, and VR. Early applications of haptic feedback were primarily rooted in domains like medical training, where tactile simulators helped trainees develop muscle memory without the risks associated with real-life procedures [1]. Over time, the potential of haptic technology began to be realized in areas such as virtual reality, where it significantly contributed to immersion and realism [2], and in mobile devices, where vibrations served as discreet notifications [3]. More recently, the emergence of the metaverse has presented a novel domain for haptic interactions. In this versatile virtual space, users can interact over vast distances, presenting numerous opportunities for haptic integration.
Consider a scenario in the metaverse where one wishes to perceive the heartbeat of another individual or a medical trainee aims to determine the regularity of a heartbeat. While one approach might be to reproduce the sound of the heartbeat, a more immersive method would allow users to physically "feel" it through haptic feedback. This paper explores the latter, suggesting that these tactile-based experiences could reshape how we interact within the metaverse. Moreover, unlike traditional methods that predominantly utilize hand-held or wearable devices for such haptic feedback, our innovative approach introduces feedback through an actuator placed beneath the user's chair. This not only ensures a consistent point of contact but also simulates a more realistic and centralized sensation, reminiscent of an actual heartbeat felt at the core of the body.
In this study, we introduce a novel technique for synthesizing Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, which capture the acoustics produced by the heart, aiming to facilitate haptic feedback corresponding to heartbeats. Our methodology begins with a PCG recording obtained from a human participant. Subsequently, smooth envelops are extracted from the recorded signals. These envelops are then partitioned into distinct phases, specifically S1 (the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing) and S2 (the soundof the aortic and pulmonary valves closing), representing the two primary heart sounds. From these two main parts, S1 and S2, we began our process to transform the PCG signals into a sensation that can be felt as a heartbeat (see Sect. II). By overlaying these envelopes with sine waves, we can recreate a sensation similar to a continuous human heartbeat.

2. Phonocardiogram (PCG) Dataset and Preprocessing
For our study, we utilized the open-access PhysioNet Dataset [4], which contains various Phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings. Our initial task was to sort the PCG signals based on BPM values, which was done as manual task generate relevant labels. Once labeled, these PCG data were further refined for our purposes as directly using the raw PCG signals may pose challenges due to inherent noise and potential distortions which could affect accurate transmission to the actuator. As a solution, we extracted the envelopes from the PCG signals as illustrated in Fig 1. These envelopes distinctly highlight the heart's sound phases. The "lub" sound or S1 signifies the commencement of systole, during which the mitral and tricuspid valves close. On the other hand, the "dub" sound or S2 signals the start of diastole, marked by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves.

3. Generating Heart Beat 

3.1 Hardware Setup 
The hardware setup is depicted in Fig.2 (a). We utilized the "Butt-kicker" as our choice of vibrotactile actuator because of its strong vibration capabilities. This actuator works by converting sound feedback into vibrations, ideal for our goal of simulating a heartbeat. For the best user experience, we mounted the actuator beneath the chair. In our configuration, we take the synthesized PCG signals, which mimics heartbeats of certain BPMs, and send them to the actuator through a sound card. An amplifier is then used to boost the signal, ensuring the desired haptic feedback is achieved.
3.2 PCG Synthesis
To create a realistic heartbeat, we synthesized PCG signals that closely match real heart sounds. We used spectral analysis on the PCG recordings, which helped us identify the key frequencies and shaped our approach.

In our process, we applied a Fourier transform to break down the frequency components of our PCG data. This revealed the primary frequencies characteristic of the heart sounds. For the S1 (Lub) sound, the key frequencies fell between 20-45 Hz, and for the S2 (Dub) sound, they were mainly in the 50-120 Hz range. Recognizing the peaks in these ranges allowed us to pinpoint the essential frequencies for each sound. Informed by the frequencies we pinpointed, we moved forward with the signal synthesis. The S1 sound was molded using a sinusoidal waveform rooted in its determined frequency. Similarly, the S2 sound was shaped through a sinusoidal curve based on its specific frequency. The amplitude for these sounds was adjusted in line with the magnitudes found in the actual PCG, guaranteeing a true-to-life heartbeat representation. This inclusion ensures the synthesis is based on a method grounded in actual heart sound analysis.

4. Perceptual Evaluation

4.1 Participants 
A total of 5 healthy participants (4 male and 1 female), aged between 25 and 32 years, were recruited to take part in this experiment. All participants reported they had no pre-existing medical conditions, sensory impairments, or neurological disorders that could potentially affect their ability to engage in the experiment. To compensate participants for their time and effort, snacks were offered as a token of appreciation for their commitment. On average each participant took 15 minutes to complete the experiment.
4.2 Procedure
For the experiment, the participants sat down on a chair. Initially, they were provided with comprehensive instructions about the experimental process, and the questionnaire was explained. In this perceptual assessment, participants were asked to give their ratings on a scale from 0 to 100 for distinct antonymous adjective pairs. These pairs, sourced from established literature, encompassed 'Unrealistic-Realistic', 'Jerky-Smooth', and 'Irritating-Pleasant'. For instance, on the 'Unrealistic-Realistic' spectrum, a score of 100 indicated a perception of utmost realism, while a score of 0 signified the opposite.
Later, headphone playing white noise and eyes mask was provide to block any possible external sound and visual cue that could distract (see Fig. 2 (a)). Then, for the main experiment, participants were exposed to feedback representing four distinct artificially generated heartbeats ranging from 75 to 120 BPM, with intervals of 15 BPM. The order in which these signals were presented was randomized for each participant.
4.3 Results and Discussion
The outcomes of the perceptual experiment, focusing on adjective ratings associated with three distinct adjective sets administered to participants at varying heart rates, are presented in Fig. 2(b). It is evident from the data that the "Pleasant" condition consistently yielded the highest average ratings, achieving a noteworthy overall average score of approximately 94.50. In contrast, the "Realism" condition displayed a greater degree of variability, resulting in a comparatively lower overall average rating of approximately 87.50 while the "Smooth Feedback" condition secured an overall average rating of approximately 91.00.
The overall results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with users showing a positive preference. However, we believe that this work will serve as the foundation of generating heart beasts for haptic feedback while the realism can be more improved by modeling the s1(lub) and s2 (dub) signals with more sophisticated approaches such as deep learning-based Long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we presented a systematic approach to generate Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for the purpose of delivering haptic heart-beat feedback. Through a rigorous process of synthesizing PCG signals and the integration of a vibrotactile actuator beneath the chair, we have achieved notable perceptual results. The data, especially in areas of pleasantness and realism signifies the robustness of our methodology. We believe that these findings serve as a promising foundation for further research and advancements in the domain of heartbeat haptic feedback.
